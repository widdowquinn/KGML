# README.md - KGML

# **NOTE: This repository is now FROZEN and will not receive further development.** I do not use it, and neither should you. For further details, see below.

The `KGML` module was incorporated into Biopython as of its [1.65 release](https://github.com/biopython/biopython/releases). Further development of the code will now continue there. Please make all pull requests against the latest version of the code in the Biopython GitHub repository, at [https://github.com/biopython/biopython](https://github.com/biopython/biopython)
